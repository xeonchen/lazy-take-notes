    """Mix microphone and system audio from two AudioSource instances.

    Chunk sizes may differ between sources: sounddevice fires at device block size (~512
    samples / 32 ms) while system capture sources produce fixed 1600-sample (100 ms)
    chunks. To handle this, _sys_buf accumulates all available system chunks on every
    read() call (non-blocking drain) and dispenses exactly len(mic_chunk) samples per
    mix — equal duration, not equal chunk count. Mic chunk timing drives output cadence
    because mic data arrives more frequently; both sources contribute equally to the
    final audio.

    The 0.5 attenuation is an anti-clipping guard, not normalization. The two sources
    are not amplitude-normalized: mic level depends on input gain, system audio level
    depends on OS system volume. If they differ significantly, one will dominate.
